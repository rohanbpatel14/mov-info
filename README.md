# **MovInfo - Personalized Movie Discovery App üé¨**

**MovInfo** is an Android application designed to simplify movie discovery. Built with **Kotlin**, powered by **TMDb API** and **MongoDB**, it provides a seamless experience for searching movies, watching trailers, and receiving personalized recommendations‚Äîall through a clean and user-friendly interface.

## **Features**

- **Search Movies**: Access a global database with diverse genres and languages.  
- **Watch Trailers**: Preview movies with integrated trailers.  
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get tailored suggestions based on your watch history.  
- **Movie Info**: View detailed summaries, cast details, and ratings.  
- **Explore Globally**: Discover movies from different regions and languages.

## **Architecture**

MovInfo employs a **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and modularity. This design separates business logic, UI, and data handling, making the app testable and robust.

### **Core Components**
- **Model**: Handles business logic and fetches movie data from TMDb API and MongoDB.  
- **View**: Renders the user interface and observes changes from the ViewModel.  
- **ViewModel**: Mediates between the Model and View, exposing observable data streams to the View.  

### **Design Patterns**
- Single Activity  
- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)  
- Single Source of Truth (SSOT)  
- Repository Pattern (Local Cache & Remote Data Source)
